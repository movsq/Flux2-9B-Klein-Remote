# ComfyLink

**Generate with Flux 2 from your phone. End-to-end encrypted. Your prompts stay yours.**

Run Flux 2 on your own PC's GPU and use it from any browser — phone, tablet, laptop — without exposing a single port on your home network. You deploy a lightweight relay server on a cheap VPS (or a Tailscale-connected machine); your PC connects to it outbound. The relay is architecturally blind: it forwards encrypted blobs it cannot read. No cloud subscription. No one else processing your images.

## How it works

```
[Any browser] ──── WSS encrypted ────▶ [VPS relay] ──── WSS encrypted ────▶ [PC + ComfyUI]
```

Your PC runs ComfyUI and a lightweight Python bridge. It connects *outbound* to the relay — no port-forwarding, no dynamic DNS, no firewall rules. The relay brokers WebSocket connections between your browser and your PC; it never decrypts anything.

**One PC per deployment.** ComfyLink is designed for personal or small-group use. You run the relay, you control who gets in. The relay and your PC authenticate through a shared secret (`PC_SECRET`); this is a 1:1 relationship by design.

**No public VPS required.** If you run [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on both your PC and VPS, you can skip exposing the relay to the public internet entirely and keep everything inside your private mesh network.

## Features

- **End-to-end encryption** — every job (prompt, reference images, result) is encrypted on-device with ECDH-AES-GCM; the relay sees only opaque blobs
- **Encrypted vault** — generated images are stored as encrypted blobs; the decryption key is held by you and wrapped with your biometric/passkey or password; the server has no access to your content
- **Two distinct access paths:**
  - **Google account** — full account with quota tracking, vault, gallery, and ToS acceptance flow; suited for trusted users who will use the tool regularly
  - **Access code** — no account, no sign-up, no Google required; paste a code and generate; suited for sharing with less technical friends or one-off access
- **Per-user quotas** — admin-configurable job limits per account
- **Admin panel** — manage users, issue and revoke access codes, adjust quotas
- **WebAuthn / biometric vault unlock** — vault unlocked with passkey, fingerprint, or password; no master password typed in plaintext
- **Single-reference and multi-reference image generation** — Flux 2 Klein 9B GGUF workflow with model and quantization selection

## Privacy

- **Relay:** receives only encrypted blobs; cannot read prompts, reference images, or results even under compulsion
- **Vault:** encrypted blobs stored server-side; your key never leaves your device; a lawful data request produces ciphertext the server cannot decrypt
- **ComfyUI:** ComfyLink configures it with hardening flags (`--disable-metadata`, `--database-url sqlite:///:memory:`, `--verbose CRITICAL`) to reduce data retention; ComfyUI is a third-party component running on the deployer's machine — we don't control its internals
- **pc-client:** deletes each prompt from ComfyUI's in-memory history immediately after the result image is downloaded
