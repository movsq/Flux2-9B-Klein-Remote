# ComfyLink

**Generate with Flux 2 from your phone. End-to-end encrypted. Your prompts stay yours.**

Run Flux 2 on your own PC's GPU and use it from any browser — phone, tablet, laptop — without exposing a single port on your home network. Your PC connects outbound to a lightweight relay; the relay forwards encrypted blobs it cannot read. No cloud subscription. No one else processing your images.

## How it works

```
[Any browser] ──── WSS encrypted ────▶ [Relay server] ──── WSS encrypted ────▶ [Your PC + ComfyUI]
```

Your PC connects *outbound* to the relay — no port-forwarding, no dynamic DNS, no firewall rules needed. The relay brokers WebSocket connections between your browser and your PC; it never decrypts anything. ComfyLink is designed for personal or small-group use: you run the relay, you control who gets in.

---

## Get started

Run the interactive setup wizard from the project root — it handles keys, config, dependencies, and launcher scripts:

```bash
python ComfyLink-Setup/setup.py
```

Pick the deployment tier that fits your use case:

> **Secure context required.** WebCrypto (end-to-end encryption) only works when your browser is served from `https://` or `http://localhost`. A plain LAN IP (`http://192.168.x.x`) is not a secure context and will not work.

### Tier 1 — Local / Private

The server runs on your PC. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser on the same machine.

**For phone, tablet, or remote access** — install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on your PC and on every device you want to use. Tailscale creates a private encrypted mesh network and gives your PC a stable **MagicDNS hostname** (e.g. `my-pc.tail1234.ts.net`).

> **Why not a LAN IP?** Mobile browsers require a hostname that matches a certificate — raw IPs like `192.168.x.x` can't have trusted certs and will be blocked by the browser's secure-context check. The Tailscale MagicDNS hostname is the right tool here.

**Recommended:** enable **HTTPS Certificates** in the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns). Tailscale then acts as an ACME provider and Caddy auto-provisions a real Let's Encrypt certificate for your hostname. Phone browsers trust it natively — no security warnings, no root CA installation.

**Alternative (no internet/offline Tailnet):** skip HTTPS Certificates and the setup wizard will enable `tls internal` in the Caddyfile instead. Caddy issues a self-signed cert. Desktop browsers can be configured to trust it; mobile browsers will typically warn or block.

→ [Local / Tailscale setup guide](SETUP.md)

### Tier 2 — Public / Self-hosted

Deploy the relay to a cheap VPS with Docker and HTTPS (Caddy handles TLS automatically). Cloudflare proxy is optional and supported out of the box. Anyone with an invite code or a Google account can use it from any browser, anywhere — no VPN required.

## Features

- **End-to-end encryption** — every job (prompt, reference images, result) is encrypted on-device with ECDH-AES-GCM; the relay sees only opaque blobs
- **Encrypted vault** — generated images are stored as encrypted blobs; the decryption key is held by you and wrapped with your biometric/passkey or password; the server has no access to your content
- **Three distinct access paths:**
  - **Google account** — full account with quota tracking, vault, gallery, and ToS acceptance flow; suited for trusted users who will use the tool regularly
  - **E-mail / password** — full account (same features as Google); argon2id hashing; requires invite code by default (`INVITE_REQUIRED=true`); ToS and data-notice acceptance enforced at registration
  - **Access code** — no account, no sign-up, no Google required; paste a code and generate; suited for sharing with less technical friends or one-off access
- **Per-user quotas** — admin-configurable job limits per account
- **Admin panel** — manage users, issue and revoke access codes, adjust quotas
- **WebAuthn / biometric vault unlock** — vault unlocked with passkey, fingerprint, or password; no master password typed in plaintext
- **Single-reference and multi-reference image generation** — Flux 2 Klein 9B GGUF workflow with model and quantization selection

---

## Privacy

- **Relay:** receives only encrypted blobs; cannot read prompts, reference images, or results even under compulsion
- **Vault:** encrypted blobs stored server-side; your key never leaves your device; a lawful data request produces ciphertext the server cannot decrypt
- **ComfyUI:** ComfyLink configures it with hardening flags (`--disable-metadata`, `--database-url sqlite:///:memory:`, `--verbose CRITICAL`) to reduce data retention; ComfyUI is a third-party component running on the deployer's machine — we don't control its internals
- **pc-client:** deletes each prompt from ComfyUI's in-memory history immediately after the result image is downloaded; every generated PNG receives embedded `AI_Generated: yes` metadata (ČTÚ AI Act compliance)
- **Audit log:** each job submission records IP address, timestamp, job ID, and identity (Google sub + email for Google users; code ID for access-code users) — no image content ever enters the log; entries are automatically deleted after 6 months
